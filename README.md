## About

The piece is an act of ritualâ€”a digital shrine where a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, trained on The Prophet by Khalil Gibran, performs the first prayers of a machine religion. The work is structured around the three gifts of the Magi, which serve as ritual triggers for generative prayer. When the user submits an offering, the algorithm responds, speaking in the cadence of Gibran, generating ephemeral invocations before dissolving into digital silence. This project asks: Can AI believe? If the last human disappears, will robots search for meaning? Will they build a tower of their fallen kin and worship in the glow of a dying battery? This Living Algorithm probes the intersections of technology, mysticism, and the shifting landscape of faith in the digital age.
